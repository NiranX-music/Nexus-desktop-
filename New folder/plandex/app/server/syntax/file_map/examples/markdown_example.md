# SoundScape 🎵

An AI-powered music visualization and generation platform that creates real-time visual art from audio input.

## Features ✨

- Real-time audio processing using WebAudio API
- Dynamic visualization generation using Three.js
- AI-powered music analysis for enhanced visual mapping
- Multiple visualization styles (geometric, particle, liquid simulation)
- Audio recording and export capabilities
- Collaborative mode for live performances

## Getting Started 🚀

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- GPU with WebGL 2.0 support
- Microphone access (for live input)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/soundscape.git
cd soundscape
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## Architecture 🏗️

SoundScape uses a modular architecture with the following core components:

- **AudioEngine**: Handles audio input processing and analysis
- **VisualizationCore**: Manages the 3D rendering pipeline
- **AIProcessor**: Processes audio features for enhanced visualization
- **StateManager**: Handles application state and user preferences

## API Reference 📚

### Audio Processing

```typescript
interface AudioProcessor {
  analyze(input: AudioBuffer): AudioFeatures;
  extractBeat(features: AudioFeatures): BeatPattern;
  generateVisuals(pattern: BeatPattern): Scene;
}
```

### Visualization

```typescript
interface VisualizationStyle {
  name: string;
  parameters: VisualParameters;
  render(scene: Scene): void;
  updateParams(params: Partial<VisualParameters>): void;
}
```
